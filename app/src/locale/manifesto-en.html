<h1>Well Being and Being Well in the 21st Century</h1>
This project uses a variety of data sources and techniques to develop measures of subjective well-being that complement traditional measures of economic activity and provide a more complete picture of whether people in our world are living well.  Our goal is to provide innovative resources that leverage data to spur public debate and academic research on subjective well being.  We hope that students, teachers, public officials, and civil society will use our tools to better understand subjective well-being. We hope that researchers will download our state and regional indices to generate new insights about subjective well-being [Terms of use](#/doc/termsOfUse)

<h3>What is Well Being?</h3>
Well being can refer to many different ideas.  In this case, we are referring to what researchers call “subjective well-being,” that is, how people feel.  Subjective well-being can refer to emotions (such as happiness, anger, or stress), evaluations (such as whether one is satisfied with their life) or whether one feels fulfilled and that one’s life has purpose and value. For more information on subjective well being, you can read [this page](http://example.com).  

<h3>Why not just use GDP?</h3>
A common measure of whether society is doing well is GDP (or GNP), which measures the monetary value of goods and services produced in a country.  These are important measures of the productivity of the economy, but not necessarily good measures of how a society is doing and whether the members of that society are leading good lives.  GDP measures monetary transactions, not value, and not well-being.  Awareness of this gap between what GDP measures and what we want to measure has given rise to the “Beyond GDP” movement, which encompasses many different strategies for measuring social progress in a more meaningful way.

<h3>Our methodology</h3>
We use diverse tools and data sources to measure and analyze well-being.  Our starting point is survey data on what is called “subjective well-being,” (SWB) which refers to how well people say they are - for example, how happy, sad, worried, or satisfied they feel (link to further information on subjective well-being measures).  From there we use statistical analysis and data on what people are searching for on the internet to develop the two interfaces presented here.

<h3>Well-being and individual characteristics</h3>
To see how individual characteristics – such as age, sex, or family structure – are related to life satisfaction in different countries, you can use the interactive tool.  Using survey data, we identify the factors related to SWB for individuals in XX European countries and build a [model](#/doc/populationDataMethodology) that predicts SWB in different countries.  [Give it a try](#/population-data).

<h3>Mapping well-being over time and space</h3>
To track overall levels of well-being over time, and see how trends in different life categories such as family stress, leisure, or personal security are related to those levels, you can use the internet search tracker.  We group internet search terms into different categories (such as those related to family stress), see how the volume of those search terms is related to surveyed well-being, and build a [model](#/doc/exploreIndexMethodology) that predicts SWB over time.  [Get started](#/explore-index).
