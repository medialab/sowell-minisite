The data we use in the ESvie tool comes from the Survey «Statistiques sur les Revenus et Conditions de Vie » (SRCV) conducted by the Insee over almost 3 800 people that are at least 18 years old. We use the data of three waves: from 2010 to 2013.

We use run a linear regression (OLS approach) to estimate the relationship (i.e. coefficient) between individual characteristics (like being married, having kids, etc.) and Well-being.

*	Explained variables: General Satisfaction, Leisure Satisfaction, Housing Satisfaction and Relations Satisfaction.
*	Explanatory variables: Education level, age, income, gender, citizenship, marital status, number of kids, spouse working, has joined an association, actual situation (unemployed, employed, etc.) and housing type.

## Interpretation

ESvie tool allows you to see how different types of people are feeling in terms of well-being, with respect to other profiles in France. The relative situation is given by the color of each circle: the saddest person has a gray face and the happiest one a green face. There are different shades of colors so you will identify the situation of your profile according to its face/color:

 If your profile is represented by a green circle then you’re in the top 25% of the distribution. In other words, that profile is among the 25% most satisfied French people. If the circle is gray, that means the profile is among the 25% less satisfied French people.
