<h1>Mapping the course of well-being and life aspects over time</h1>

<h3>What makes for a good life?</h3>
The movement to use well-being as an indicator for societal progress faces a major challenge, which is what, and how, to measure well-being and its components.  Survey-based measures – such asking people whether they are satisfied with their lives or whether they feel happy – are the crucial first step in measurement.  But, just as GDP is composed of different sectors, such as agriculture and manufacturing, we must try to understand what the components of well-being are, such as jobs, family happiness, and personal security.  

<h3>A new approach to measurement</h3>
IBBD (Indice de Bien-être du Big Data in french) uses a new approach: internet search volumes are sorted into groups of related concepts, which are called Life Aspects (we use both statistical methods and common sense to sort these categories link).  Changes in Life Aspects over time help us understand what is happening in our world and what is on people’s minds.  

<h3>A model of well-being</h3>
These Life Aspects are used to build a model, calibrated to survey measures, to predict well-being.  These predictions are tested for accuracy against surveyed well-being (using an out of sample test link to methodology).  This model then helps tease apart the components of well-being, which we then track over time, and use to produce estimates of well-being at a more local level, where survey data is not available.

<h3>Insights from IBBD</h3>
Let’s see Life Aspects and Well-Being in different states changed during the Great Recession, and after the election of President Obama. 

<h3>What IBBD cannot do</h3>
These categories of search terms, and the well-being indices that they predict, can only be compared in one place over time.  They cannot be compared over places.  It is not currently possible to say, for example, that people in New York are happier, or less happy, than people in Wisconsin.  All we can say is that people in Wisconsin are more or less happy relative to their general level of happiness, and people in New York are more or less happy relative to their general level of happiness.
