<h1> Life Satisfaction Estimator - ESVie </h1>


<h3>Inequality in Life Satisfaction</h3>
When French people are asked to rate their life satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10, on average, they answer around 7.  But – as with income – there are some people who answer 10, some people who answer 0, and lots of people in between.  As with income, levels of life satisfaction are correlated to a variety of personal characteristics like age, gender, number of children and so on.

<h3>What can I do with ESVie?</h3>
ESVie is designed to help visualize these differences in life satisfaction.  What kinds of people are more or less satisfied?  What if you change some characteristics? The interactive tool will show you where the average person with these characteristics is among the most or least satisfied people in France for four separate dimensions (general, housing, leisure, and relationships). Specifically, ESVie tells you which decile they are predicted to be in.

<h3>Try an example</h3>
For example, let’s imagine a 40 year old man who has the French nationality, is in a couple with two children, with a professional degree, who has a job and has slightly below the median income. His partner is has a job. He rents his home, and belongs to at least one association. For this person, we see that the predicted life satisfaction in general is in the 7th decile (meaning that it his higher than 70% of the population), satisfaction with leisure is in the 6th decile, satisfaction with housing is in the 3rd decile, and satisfaction with relationships is in the 10th decile. 

<h3>See how changes affect the prediction</h3>
Now, try changing a characteristics and see what happens to the predicted level of well-being. For example, let’s leave everything the same with our example person, except that now the person is a woman instead of a man. What do we observe? Her life satisfaction in general has dropped a little bit the 6th decile, satisfaction with housing and relationships remains the same, but satisfaction with leisure has dropped to the 4th decile – a large drop. Why is this? 

<h3>Insight into inequalities in French society</h3>
In our example, we see that satisfaction with leisure time is strongly related to gender for someone with those characteristics. To get more insight into why this is, you might look at what happens if there are no children in the picture. You might see whether this effect is offset if the family has a higher income.

<h3>But…. ESVie cannot predict a particular individual’s life satisfaction accurately</h3>
Even though life satisfaction is positively correlated with, for example, income, we all know that this is not the whole story: there are plenty of rich people who are miserable, and plenty of people living with modest incomes that are happy. Most of what makes any individual satisfied with their life comes from their own personality and attitudes. The coefficients are accurate at a population level, and should be understood as reflecting differences in averages between groups. 

<h3>And… ESVie will not be able to help you decide to get married, buy a house, or have children</h3>
There are many variables that are not included in the model used on this website. Some of these variables – like individual personality – are not included because they are difficult to measure and do not exist in the database used here. Those “omitted” variables can influence both decisions like whether to get a divorce and life satisfaction – and so the correlation of getting a divorce and life satisfaction can be biased. Do not make any life decisions based on ESVie!
